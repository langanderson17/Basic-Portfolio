					<p>Hello reader. My name is Lang Anderson and I'm glad you decided to read about me. I am 21 years old and have lived in Austin, TX for my whole life. I have always been interested in technology since I got my first cell phone. Today, I begin my pursuit of becoming a Web Developer. I have much to learn but I am excited to dive into the coding world. In my free time I like to play a video game called Leauge of Legends, and play a card game called Texas Hold'em. I aspire to be good at the games, as I have a competative nature.
